# Custom Messages

We extend the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification)
with custom messages to provide better LaTeX integration.
These messages are _optional_ and it is up to the client to support them.

## Build Request

The build request is sent from the client to the server to build a given LaTeX document.

_Request_:

- method: 'textDocument/build'
- params: `BuildTextDocumentParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface BuildTextDocumentParams {
  /**
   * The text document to build.
   */
  textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;
}
```

_Response_:

- result: `BuildResult` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface BuildResult {
  /**
   * The status of the build process.
   */
  status: BuildStatus;
}

enum BuildStatus {
  /**
   * The build process terminated without any errors.
   */
  Success = 0,

  /**
   * The build process terminated with errors.
   */
  Error = 1,

  /**
   * The build process failed to start or crashed.
   */
  Failure = 2,

  /**
   * The build process was cancelled.
   */
  Cancelled = 3,
}
```

## Forward Search Request

The forward search request is sent from the client to the server when the user requests a forward search via SyncTeX.

_Request_:

- method: 'textDocument/forwardSearch'
- params: [`TextDocumentPositionParams`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocumentPositionParams)

_Response_:

- result: `ForwardSearchResult` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ForwardSearchResult {
  /**
   * The status of the previewer process.
   */
  status: ForwardSearchStatus;
}

enum ForwardSearchStatus {
  /**
   * The previewer process executed the command without any errors.
   */
  Success = 0,

  /**
   * The previewer process executed the command with errors.
   */
  Error = 1,

  /**
   * The previewer process failed to start or crashed.
   */
  Failure = 2,

  /**
   * The previewer command is not configured.
   */
  Unconfigured = 3,
}
```
